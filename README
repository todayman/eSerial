eSerial 0.1 (http://github.com/todayman/eSerial)

eSerial is a library for the serialization of C++ objects.
It is most useful (I think) for writing objects to disk.

Currently, it only supports writing to XML.

Dependencies:
The library itself only depends on libxml (http://www.xmlsoft.org/).
Running the tests requires Google Test (https://code.google.com/p/googletest/).

I have written this using C++11 features and libc++.

Documentation is coming... I promise...
You can build what exists so far by running doxygen in the root directory.
The product will be in docs.

Building
==================
To build eSerial, open the Xcode project, make sure that the "eSerial" scheme
is selected, and build.  Using the "test" scheme will build and run the tests.
There is a Makefile, so you can run make.  It worked the last time I tried, but
may not be up to date.


TODO
==================
Check that the #includes have the right pathnames *
High-level documentation *
	How to write implementations for other file formats *
Parser::read(string name, const char * * astring) *

Parser won't properly construct pointers that point to stack objects
when they are out of order in the XML file.  Maybe it does, but I need to
investigate this.

Natively support STL containers

Binary file format

The starred things are going to get done in the near future.
I would like to have support for STL containers, but I haven't figured out
the API for it just yet.
I would also like to have binary files, but that's not much of a need, so that
has the lowest priority.
