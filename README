eSerial (http://github.com/todayman/eSerial)

eSerial is a library for the serialization of C++ objects.
It is most useful (I think) for writing objects to disk.

Currently, it only supports writing to XML.

Dependencies:
The library itself only depends on libxml (http://www.xmlsoft.org/).
Running the tests requires Google Test (https://code.google.com/p/googletest/).

I have written this using C++11 features and libc++.

To build eSerial, open the Xcode project, make sure that the "eSerial" scheme
is selected, and build.  Using the "test" scheme will build and run the tests.
There is a Makefile, so you can run make.  It worked the last time I tried, but
may not be up to date.

Documentation is coming... I promise...
