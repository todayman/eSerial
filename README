eSerial (github.com/todayman/eSerial)

eSerial is a library for the serialization of C++ objects.
It is most useful (I think) for writing objects to disk.

Currently, it only supports writing to XML.

Dependencies:
The library itself only depends on libxml (http://www.xmlsoft.org/).
Running the tests requires Google Test (https://code.google.com/p/googletest/).

I have written this using C++11 features and libc++.  eSerial doesn't compile
with the libc++ in Xcode 4.2.1 due to a bug in libc++ (fixed in svn).

To build eSerial, open the Xcode project, make sure that the "eSerial" scheme
is selected, and build.  Using the "test" scheme will build and run the tests.

Documentation is coming... I promise...
